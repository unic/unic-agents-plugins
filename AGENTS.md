# CLAUDE.md & AGENTS.md

Guidance for any AI agent working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## What this repo is

A pnpm workspace monorepo hosting AI agent plugins developed at Unic. Today it contains Claude Code plugins; the structure supports plugins for other agents (GitHub Copilot, etc.) in the future.

## Workspace layout

```tree
apps/
├── claude-code/              # Claude Code plugins — one dir per plugin
│   ├── pr-review/
│   ├── auto-format/
│   └── unic-confluence/
└── copilot/                  # GitHub Copilot plugins (future)
packages/
├── biome-config/             # @unic/biome-config
├── tsconfig/                 # @unic/tsconfig
└── release-tools/            # @unic/release-tools (bump / sync-version / tag / verify-changelog)
docs/
└── plans/                    # Monorepo-level Ralph spec roadmap (specs 00–14)
```

Each plugin under `apps/<agent>/` also has its own `docs/plans/` for plugin-specific future work.

## Navigation

- Plugin manifests: `apps/<agent>/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`
- Shared release scripts: `packages/release-tools/scripts/`
- Monorepo roadmap: `docs/plans/`
- Process templates: `docs/process/`

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install                            # install all workspace deps
pnpm check                              # Biome + Prettier check (whole tree)
pnpm format                             # Biome + Prettier fix (whole tree)
pnpm ci:check                           # same as check, non-interactive (for CI)
pnpm test                               # run tests across all packages
pnpm typecheck                          # type-check across all packages
pnpm ralph                              # run the monorepo Ralph loop (specs 00–14)

# Per-plugin operations (after spec 03 sets up release-tools)
pnpm --filter <name> bump patch         # bump plugin version
pnpm --filter <name> verify:changelog   # check changelog
pnpm --filter <name> ralph              # run that plugin's own Ralph loop
```

## Tech stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 24 LTS (pinned `24.15.0` via `.nvmrc` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- **Package manager**: pnpm 10 (workspace mode, catalog pinning)
- **Module system**: ESM (`"type": "module"`) throughout
- **Linter/formatter**: Biome 2 for code/JSON; Prettier for Markdown only
- **Type checking**: `tsc --checkJs --noEmit` on `.mjs` files; no compilation step
- **Test runner**: `node:test` built-in

## Cross-platform requirement

Every plugin must work on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**. Use Node.js APIs (`node:path`, `node:fs`, `node:os`) instead of shell commands. CI runs all three OSes × Node 22 and 24.

## Code conventions

- Tabs for indentation in `.mjs`/`.js`/`.ts` files; spaces (2) for `.json`/`.yml`/`.yaml`
- Single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas ES5-style (enforced by Biome)
- Line width 120 (Biome)
- Prettier for Markdown only
- No TypeScript compilation — `// @ts-check` + JSDoc for type safety

## Versioning

Plugins are versioned independently. `plugin.json` is the source of truth. Use `pnpm --filter <name> bump <patch|minor|major>` — never hand-edit `marketplace.json`.

Tag scheme: `<plugin-name>@<version>` (e.g. `auto-format@0.5.5`).

## Conventional commits

Use package scope: `feat(auto-format): …`, `fix(pr-review): …`, `chore(release-tools): …`, `chore(spec-NN): …`.

## Git branching (Gitflow)

| Branch           | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`           | Production. Only receives merge commits from `develop` (or `hotfix/*`). The release workflow fires here and creates tags. |
| `develop`        | Integration. Default target for all feature PRs. CI runs on every push and PR.                                            |
| `feature/<name>` | Day-to-day work. Branch from `develop`, PR back to `develop`.                                                             |
| `hotfix/<name>`  | Urgent fixes only. Branch from `main`, PR to both `main` and `develop`.                                                   |

**Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`.** Always go through a PR.

## Release flow

To ship a new plugin version:

1. On a feature branch, bump the version: `pnpm --filter <name> bump <patch|minor|major>`
2. Add a dated entry to the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md` under the new version.
3. Open a PR targeting `develop`. CI runs `verify:changelog` on all PRs — it will fail if the changelog entry is missing or malformed.
4. After the PR merges to `develop`, open a release PR from `develop` → `main`.
5. After the release PR merges, the release workflow on `main` detects that `<name>@<version>` has no tag yet and creates it automatically.

**CI summary:**

| Event             | Root checks | Package tests        | `verify:changelog` |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| PR (any branch)   | ✓           | ✓ (changed packages) | ✓                  |
| Push to `develop` | ✓           | ✓ (changed packages) | —                  |
| Push to `main`    | ✓           | ✓ (changed packages) | —                  |

## Spec-driven development

All work starts with a spec file under `docs/plans/`. Specs follow this format:

```
# NN. Title
**Priority:** / **Effort:** / **Version impact:** / **Depends on:** / **Touches:**
## Context
## Current behaviour
## Target behaviour
## Affected files
## Implementation steps
## Verification
## Acceptance criteria
## Out of scope
```

`pnpm ralph` runs Ralph Orchestrator, which implements specs one at a time in a loop.

## Do not add

- External runtime deps to plugins unless truly essential (`auto-format` has zero; that's the bar)
- Turborepo or other build orchestrators — plain pnpm workspaces is the current choice
- Features not described in an open spec file — open a spec first

## LICENSE files

**Never create, copy, or delete `LICENSE` files.** The maintainer manages these manually in every package and plugin directory. If a spec step or acceptance criterion requires a `LICENSE` file to exist, warn the maintainer to add it themselves before continuing.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as local markdown files under `docs/issues/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

8-state vocabulary: `needs-triage` → `needs-info` → `needs-specs` → `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` → `resolved` → `closed` (or `rejected`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context repo: Per-plugin `CONTEXT.md` files (created lazily by `/grill-with-docs`) live under `apps/claude-code/<plugin>/`. A root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` may be added later. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
